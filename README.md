# JSM_SVM_MLL


The coding is the matlab implementaion for the method in paper "Gao, Q. and Lim, S., 2019. A Probabilistic Fusion of a Support Vector Machine and a Joint Sparsity Model for Hyperspectral Imagery Classification. GIScience & Remote Sensing. (DOI: 10.1080/15481603.2019.1623003"

For using the code, please make sure all the folders are in your current Matlab path, and run demo_IP, demo_PU, demo_SA for the three data sets used in the paper. The data sets included in the paper are free downloaded from http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes.
