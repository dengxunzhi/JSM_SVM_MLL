
The coding is the matlab implementaion for the method in paper"Spectral-Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Imagery with a Probabilistic Fusion of a Support Vector Machine and a Joint Sparsity Model" which has been submitted to "Computers & Geosciences" and still undergoing review.

For using the code, please make sure all the folders are in your current Matlab path, and run demo_IP, demo_PU, demo_SA for the three data sets used in the paper. The data sets included in the paper are free downloaded from http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes.
